I conducted research at Shanghai, China in a local high school called High School Attached to Shanghai Normal University (HSASNU). The main purpose for my visit there was to demonstrate how technology is used to educate young minds in the field of STEM. As reference, we used HSASNU and my high school to compare between the use of technology in an American and Chinese STEM education.
