The Randall Family Big Idea Competition is an event that takes place every year which aspiring innovators pitch their best ideas to a set of judges in hopes to win money. Our team ZMAC believed that the Adapt is the hot new mouse that will eventually be prominent in all sorts of businesses in order to improve their workflow and costs for working. The competition lasted February 22 - April 15, 2021. Throughout those weeks, we had worked hard to improve our idea and collect data in order to prove validation for our product. It goes to show that our hard work had paid off in the end which resulted in us placing second place in the competition. We were gifted with $15,000 which will be used to fund our Adapt further and allows us to take the next steps of our prototyping phase.
