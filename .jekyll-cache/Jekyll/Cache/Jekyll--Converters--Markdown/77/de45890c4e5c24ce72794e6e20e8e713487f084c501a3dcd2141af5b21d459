My name is Justin Cacal and I am a second year at the University of Pittsburgh with an intended major of Computer Engineering. One key fact about me is that I am a military brat who has been to quite a few places around the world. As I traveled with my family, I grew to love experiencing and learning different cultures. Being a part of the military also made me realize how much I wanted to help our soldiers.

<br />

I want to help our soldiers overseas by making robots that limit the amount of time they would physically have to spend on the field. The more I looked into robotic systems, the more invested I wanted to be in this line of work. I'm currently a part of Pitt RAS working on sumo bots, an Electrical Engineering intern at QinetiQ North America, and a part of a startup known as ZMAC. These experiences has helped me grow as an engineer and better understand cooperation which ultimately leads to the greatest innovation.
