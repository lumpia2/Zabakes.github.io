This would be our second competition we would enter for the ZMAC Adapt (read more in the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/tags/#Projects"> <u>project</u> </a> index). This would be a two day competition; first day was getting feedback and research, then second day would be getting extra advice from an entrepreneur and then presenting our idea. With the first day, we researched mainly on our market since we had the technical aspect of our mouse on lockdown. After a short presentation, we received feedback mainly on explaining our pain points and who we were targeting mainly. Finally, second day comes and we met up with a our mentor, Stephan Mueller, who was very helpful for trying to make our presentation more understandable for the audience. After presenting the final presentation, we had received tons of positive feedbacks. However, one critique was in regards to our idea and how they couldn't understand how it would help someone. That comment would lead us to only winning second. So with the next competition in mind, we would constantly refine our presentations and hope to win first in the Randall Family Big Idea Competition.
