Our group ZMAC entered this competition in hopes of winning the money to fund our startup. The competition started during the Summer of 2020 and lasted until December 2020. The project we were fighting for was our ZMAC Adapt (read more in the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/tags/#Projects"> <u>project</u> </a> index). This was our first competition ever, and we were really hoping to win this. We believe that our idea can really help others save time and relieve the stress of their work. However, believing in something is not enough. Making it to the semi-finals and losing was heartbreaking, but it was enough to put a drive in us. From this competition, we were able to learn more about our market and how we would get it into the hands of others. This would be our first step towards success.
