I conducted research at Shanghai, China in a local high school called High School Attached to Shanghai Normal University (HSASNU). The main purpose for my visit there was to demonstrate how technology is used to educate young minds in the field of STEM. As reference, we used HSASNU and my high school to compare the use of technology in an American and Chinese STEM education. With the help of my partner, Isabel Strinsky, we were able to create a research paper of our discovered findings and elaborate them in a formal presentation for the GSSM Colloqium event.
