<p>
My name is Justin Cacal and I am currently in my second year at the University of Pittsburgh. My intended major is Computer Engineering and I am on a Co-op rotation with the company QinetiQ. I am very excited to work with them since it has been a dream to work for a systems and defense company. I want to give back the troops in active duty and risking their lives for our country. In order to accomplish this task, I am willing to put in 100% effort into everything I do and will not stop until it is done right.
